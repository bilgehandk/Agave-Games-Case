# Agave Games Case

Agave Games is a Match-3 style puzzle game developed in Unity, featuring a drag-based linking system where players connect matching tiles by dragging between them.

## Game Mechanics

* Drag-based tile matching system (no swipe mechanics)
* Visual linking between connected tiles
* Matched tiles disappear when a valid chain is created (3+ tiles)
* Score tracking based on matched tile values
* Limited moves gameplay with win/lose conditions

## Key Features

* **Link Visualization**: Real-time visual feedback showing connections between tiles
* **Adaptive Links**: Links automatically orient based on direction (horizontal/vertical)
* **Score Animation**: Visual score feedback with floating text
* **Tile Animations**: Smooth animations for tile interactions using DOTween

## Technologies

* Unity
* C#
* DOTween (for animations)
* TextMeshPro (UI text)
* Unity Addressables (asset management)
* Universal Render Pipeline

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:bilgehandk/Agave-Games-Case.git
   ```
2. Open the project in Unity 2021 or newer.
3. Ensure all packages are properly imported (DOTween, TextMeshPro, Addressables).
4. Build Addressables via `Window > Asset Management > Addressables > Groups > Build > New Build`.
5. Open the main scene from the `Scenes` folder and press Play.

## Performance Considerations

* Uses optimized object pooling for link visualizations.
* Efficiently manages animations to prevent memory leaks.
* Properly cleans up resources when transitioning between scenes.

## Development Notes

This project demonstrates implementation of a drag-based matching system with visual linking between tiles, replacing the traditional swipe mechanics seen in many Match-3 games.

## Features

* Dynamic, scalable game board and tile system
* Drag-and-drop chain creation for matching tiles
* Visual link and animation effects (DOTween)
* Score tracking and end game screens
* Easily customizable items, board size, and win conditions
* Performance-optimized asset loading with Unity Addressables
